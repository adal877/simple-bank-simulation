# simple-bank-simulation

well, I think the name is self-explanatory, but anyway: This is a simple bank/atm-like program.  
The main idea is to practice the use of dinamically allocated vectors and structs.

## Simple problem, overcomplicated answere...

I know that the names of the variables are horrible and I might have (100% sure) over-complicated this, but, It's working and I'm working up my knowledge to make it better.  
Probably some day I'll make another version of this, but, with more functionalities and maybe something closer to a real bank/atm system, with password support and that type of things, of course terminal only.

# A little remember
I'm brazilian, so the program accepts the CPF as document. I've made a parser to accept this, not any type of north american national document.  
I'll probably do something like this later.
The parser accepts exactly 11 characters and it will parse the '.' and '-' and then finnaly delets it (if it exists in the input).
